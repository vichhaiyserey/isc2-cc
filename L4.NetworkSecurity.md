## Module 1: Understand Computer Networking

Domain D4.1.1, D4.1.2

### What is Networking

A network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data, information or resources.

To properly establish secure data communications, it is important to explore all of the technologies involved in computer communications. From hardware and software to protocols and encryption and beyond, there are many details, standards and procedures to be familiar with.

#### Types of Networks

There are two basic types of networks:

* Local area network (LAN) - A local area network (LAN) is a network typically spanning a single floor or building. This is commonly a limited geographical area.
* Wide area network (WAN) - Wide area network (WAN) is the term usually assigned to the long-distance connections between geographically remote networks.

#### Network Devices

* **Hubs** are used to connect multiple devices in a network. They’re less likely to be seen in business or corporate networks than in home networks. Hubs are wired devices and are not as smart as switches or routers.

* You might consider using **a switch**, or what is also known as an intelligent hub. Switches are wired devices that know the addresses of the devices connected to them and route traffic to that port/device rather than retransmitting to all devices. Offering greater efficiency for traffic delivery and improving the overall throughput of data, switches are smarter than hubs, but not as smart as routers. Switches can also create separate broadcast domains when used to create VLANs, which will be discussed later.

* **Routers** are used to control traffic flow on networks and are often used to connect similar networks and control traffic flow between them. Routers can be wired or wireless and can connect multiple switches. Smarter than hubs and switches, routers determine the most efficient “route” for the traffic to flow across the network.

* **Firewalls** are essential tools in managing and controlling network traffic and protecting the network. A firewall is a network device used to filter traffic. It is typically deployed between a private network and the internet, but it can also be deployed between departments (segmented networks) within an organization (overall network). Firewalls filter traffic based on a defined set of rules, also called filters or access control lists.

* A **server** is a computer that provides information to other computers on a network. Some common servers are web servers, email servers, print servers, database servers and file servers. All of these are, by design, networked and accessed in some way by a client computer. Servers are usually secured differently than workstations to protect the information they contain.

* **Endpoints** are the ends of a network communication link. One end is often at a server where a resource resides, and the other end is often a client making a request to use a network resource. An endpoint can be another server, desktop workstation, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or any other end user device.

#### Other Networking Terms

* Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connections of networked devices. This standard defines the way data is formatted over the wire to ensure disparate devices can communicate over the same cables.

* Media Access Control (MAC) Address - Every network device is assigned a Media Access Control (MAC) address. An example is 00-13-02-1F-58-F5. The first 3 bytes (24 bits) of the address denote the vendor or manufacturer of the physical network interface. No two devices can have the same MAC address in the same local network; otherwise an address conflict occurs.

* Internet Protocol (IP) Address - While MAC addresses are generally assigned in the firmware of the interface, IP hosts associate that address with a unique logical address. This logical IP address represents the network interface within the network and can be useful to maintain communications when a physical device is swapped with new hardware. Examples are 192.168.1.1 and 2001:db8::ffff:0:1.

### Networking Models

Many different models, architectures and standards exist that provide ways to interconnect different hardware and software systems with each other for the purposes of sharing information, coordinating their activities and accomplishing joint or shared tasks.

Computers and networks emerge from the integration of communication devices, storage devices, processing devices, security devices, input devices, output devices, operating systems, software, services, data and people.

Translating the organization’s security needs into safe, reliable and effective network systems needs to start with a simple premise. The purpose of all communications is to exchange information and ideas between people and organizations so that they can get work done.

Those simple goals can be re-expressed in network (and security) terms such as:

* Provide reliable, managed communications between hosts (and users)
* Isolate functions in layers
* Use packets (representation of data at L3 of OSI model ) as the basis of communication
* Standardize routing, addressing and control
* Allow layers beyond internetworking to add functionality
* Be vendor-agnostic, scalable and resilient

In the most basic form, a network model has at least two layers:

* UPPER LAYER APPLICATION: also known as the host or application layer, is responsible for managing the integrity of a connection and controlling the session as well as establishing, maintaining and terminating communication sessions between two computers. It is also responsible for transforming data received from the Application Layer into a format that any system can understand. And finally, it allows applications to communicate and determines whether a remote communication partner is available and accessible.
    * APPLICATION
        * APPLICATION 7
        * PRESENTATION 6
        * SESSION 5
* LOWER LAYER: it is often referred to as the media or transport layer and is responsible for receiving bits from the physical connection medium and converting them into a frame. Frames are grouped into standardized sizes. Think of frames as a bucket and the bits as water. If the buckets are sized similarly and the water is contained within the buckets, the data can be transported in a controlled manner. Route data is added to the frames of data to create packets. In other words, a destination address is added to the bucket. Once we have the buckets sorted and ready to go, the host layer takes over.
    * DATA TRANSPORT
        * TRANSPORT 4
        * NETWORK 3
        * DATA LINK 2
        * PHYSICAL 1

### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

The OSI Model was developed to establish a common way to describe the communication structure for interconnected computer systems. The OSI model serves as an abstract framework, or theoretical model, for how protocols should function in an ideal world, on ideal hardware. Thus, the OSI model has become a common conceptual reference that is used to understand the communication of various hierarchical components from software interfaces to physical hardware.

The OSI model divides networking tasks into seven distinct layers. Each layer is responsible for performing specific tasks or operations with the goal of supporting data exchange (in other words, network communication) between two computers. The layers are interchangeably referenced by name or layer number. For example, Layer 3 is also known as the Network Layer. The layers are ordered specifically to indicate how information flows through the various levels of communication. Each layer communicates directly with the layer above and the layer below it. For example, Layer 3 communicates with both the Data Link (2) and Transport (4) layers.

The Application, Presentation, and Session Layers (5-7) are commonly referred to simply as data. However, each layer has the potential to perform encapsulation (enforcement of data hiding and code hiding during all phases of software development and operational use. Bundling together data and methods is the process of encapsulation; its opposite process may be called unpacking, revealing, or using other terms. Also used to refer to taking any set of data and packaging it or hiding it in another data structure, as is common in network protocols and encryption.). Encapsulation is the addition of header and possibly a footer (trailer) data by a protocol used at that layer of the OSI model. Encapsulation is particularly important when discussing Transport, Network and Data Link layers (2-4), which all generally include some form of header. At the Physical Layer (1), the data unit is converted into binary, i.e., 01010111, and sent across physical wires such as an ethernet cable.  

It's worth mapping some common networking terminology to the OSI Model so you can see the value in the conceptual model.

Consider the following examples: 

* When someone references an image file like a JPEG or PNG, we are talking about the Presentation Layer (6). 
* When discussing logical ports such as NetBIOS, we are discussing the Session Layer (5).
* When discussing TCP/UDP, we are discussing the Transport Layer (4).
* When discussing routers sending packets, we are discussing the Network Layer (3). 
* When discussing switches, bridges or WAPs sending frames, we are discussing the Data Link Layer (2).

Encapsulation occurs as the data moves down the OSI model from Application to Physical. As data is encapsulated at each descending layer, the previous layer’s header, payload and footer are all treated as the next layer’s payload. The data unit size increases as we move down the conceptual model and the contents continue to encapsulate.  

The inverse action occurs as data moves up the OSI model layers from Physical to Application. This process is known as de-encapsulation  (or decapsulation). The header and footer are used to properly interpret the data payload and are then discarded. As we move up the OSI model, the data unit becomes smaller. The encapsulation/de-encapsulation process is best depicted visually below: 

|            |             |              |                 |                |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 7          | Application |              |        DATA     |                |
| 6          | Presentation| Header -->   |      ||DATA     |                |
| 5          | Session     |              |     |||DATA     |                |
| 4          | Transport   |              |    ||||DATA     |                |
| 3          | Network     |              |   |||||DATA     |                |
| 2          | Data Link   |              |  ||||||DATA||   |   <-- Footer   |
| 1          | Physical    |              | |||||||DATA|||  |                |

### Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

The OSI model wasn’t the first or only attempt to streamline networking protocols or establish a common communications standard. In fact, the most widely used protocol today, TCP/IP, was developed in the early 1970s. The OSI model was not developed until the late 1970s. The TCP/IP protocol stack focuses on the core functions of networking.  

||TCP/IP Protocol Architecture Layers| |
|-|-----------------------------------|-|
|Application Layer |Defines the protocols for the transport layer|
|Transport Layer   |Permits data to move among devices|
|Internet Layer    |Creates/inserts packets|
|Network Interface Layer 	|How data moves through the network|

The most widely used protocol suite is TCP/IP, but it is not just a single protocol; rather, it is a protocol stack comprising dozens of individual protocols. TCP/IP is a platform-independent protocol based on open standards. However, this is both a benefit and a drawback. TCP/IP can be found in just about every available operating system, but it consumes a significant amount of resources and is relatively easy to hack into because it was designed for ease of use rather than for security. 

At the Application Layer, TCP/IP protocols include **Telnet**, File Transfer Protocol (**FTP**), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (**SMTP**), and Domain Name Service (**DNS**). The two primary Transport Layer protocols of TCP/IP are **TCP and UDP**. **TCP is a full-duplex connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a simplex connectionless protocol**. In the Internet Layer, **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** is used to determine the health of a network or a specific link. **ICMP is utilized by ping, traceroute and other network management tools**. The ping utility employs ICMP echo packets and bounces them off remote systems. Thus, you can use ping to determine whether the remote system is online, whether the remote system is responding promptly, whether the intermediary systems are supporting communications, and the level of performance efficiency at which the intermediary systems are communicating.

* Application, Presentation and Session layers at OSI model is equivalent to Application Layer at TCP/IP, and the protocol suite is: FTP, Telnet, SNMP, LPD, TFPT, SMTP, NFS, X Window.
* Transport layer are the same between OSI model and TCP/IP model, protocol suite: TCP, UDP
* Network layer at OSI model is equivalent to Internet layer at TCP/IP model, and protocol suite is: IGMP, IP, ICMP
* Data link and Physical layer at OSI model is equivalent at Network Interface layer at TCP/IP, and protocol suite is: Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI

### Base concepts

* Switch: A device that routes traffic to the port of a known device
* Server: A computer that provides information to other computers
* Firewall: A device that filters network traffic based on a defined set of rules
* Ethernet: A standard that defines wired communications of networked devices
* IP Address: Logical address representing the network interface
* MAC Address: Address that denotes the vendor or manufactures of the physical network interface

### Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)

IPv4 provides a 32-bit address space. IPv6 provides a 128-bit address space. The first one is exhausted nowadays, but it is still used because of the NAT technology. 32 bits means 4 octets of 8 bits, which is represented in a dotted decimal notation such as 192.168.0.1, which means in binary notation 11000000 10101000 00000000 00000001

IP hosts/devices associate an address with a unique logical address. An IPv4 address is expressed as four octets separated by a dot (.), for example, 216.12.146.140. Each octet may have a value between 0 and 255. However, **0 is the network itself (not a device on that network), and 255 is generally reserved for broadcast purposes**. Each address is subdivided into two parts: **the network number and the host**. The network number assigned by an external organization, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), represents the organization’s network. The host represents the network interface within the network.  

**To ease network administration, networks are typically divided into subnets**. Because subnets cannot be distinguished with the addressing scheme discussed so far, a separate mechanism, **the subnet mask**, is used to define the part of the address used for the subnet. The mask is usually converted to decimal notation like 255.255.255.0. **With the ever-increasing number of computers and networked devices, it is clear that IPv4 does not provide enough addresses for our needs.** To overcome this shortcoming, **IPv4 was sub-divided into public and private address ranges.** Public addresses are limited with IPv4, but this issue was addressed in part with private addressing. Private addresses can be shared by anyone, and it is highly likely that everyone on your street is using the same address scheme.  

The nature of the addressing scheme established by IPv4 meant that network designers had to start thinking in terms of IP address reuse. IPv4 facilitated this in several ways, such as its creation of the private address groups; this allows every LAN in every SOHO (small office, home office) situation to use addresses such as 192.168.2.xxx for its internal network addresses, without fear that some other system can intercept traffic on their LAN. This table shows the private addresses available for anyone to use:

| RANGE |
|-------|
|10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.254|
|172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.254|
|192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.254|

The first octet of **127 is reserved for a computer’s loopback address**. Usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is used. **The loopback address is used to provide a mechanism for self-diagnosis and troubleshooting at the machine level**. This mechanism allows a network administrator to treat a local machine as if it were a remote machine and ping the network interface to establish whether it is operational.

IPv6 is a modernization of IPv4, which addressed a number of weaknesses in the IPv4 environment:

    * A much larger address field: IPv6 addresses are **128 bits**, which supports 2128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 hosts. **This ensures that we will not run out of addresses**.
    * Improved security:** IPsec is an optional part of IPv4 networks, but a mandatory component of IPv6 networks**. This will help ensure the integrity and confidentiality of IP packets and allow communicating partners **to authenticate with each other**.
    * Improved quality of service (QoS): This will help services obtain an appropriate share of a network’s bandwidth.

An IPv6 address is shown as **8 groups of four digits**. Instead of numeric (0-9) digits like IPv4, **IPv6 addresses use the hexadecimal range (0000-ffff) and are separated by colons (:)** rather than periods (.). An example IPv6 address is **2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ffff:0000:0001**. To make it easier for humans to read and type, it can be shortened by removing the leading zeros at the beginning of each field and substituting two colons (::) for the longest consecutive zero fields. All fields must retain at least one digit. After shortening, the example address above is rendered as 2001:db8::ffff:0:1, which is much easier to type. As in IPv4, there are some addresses and ranges that are reserved for special uses:

    * ::1 is the local loopback address, used the same as 127.0.0.1 in IPv4.
    * The range 2001:db8:: to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff is reserved for documentation use, just like in the examples above.
    * **fc00**:: to **fdff**:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff are addresses reserved for internal network use and are not routable on the internet.

### What is WiFi?

Wireless networking is a popular method of connecting corporate and home systems because of the ease of deployment and relatively low cost. It has made networking more versatile than ever before. Workstations and portable systems are no longer tied to a cable but can roam freely within the signal range of the deployed wireless access points. However, with this freedom comes additional vulnerabilities.

Wi-Fi range is generally wide enough for most homes or small offices, and range extenders may be placed strategically to extend the signal for larger campuses or homes. Over time the Wi-Fi standard has evolved, with each updated version faster than the last.  

In a LAN, threat actors need to enter the physical space or immediate vicinity of the physical media itself. For wired networks, this can be done by placing sniffer taps onto cables, plugging in USB devices, or using other tools that require physical access to the network. By contrast, wireless media intrusions can happen at a distance. 

### Security of the Network 

TCP/IP’s vulnerabilities are numerous. Improperly implemented TCP/IP stacks in various operating systems are vulnerable to various **DoS/DDoS attacks**, **fragment attacks**, **oversized packet attacks**, **spoofing attacks**, **and man-in-the-middle attacks**. TCP/IP (as well as most protocols) is also subject to passive attacks via monitoring or sniffing. Network monitoring, or sniffing, is the act of monitoring traffic patterns to obtain information about a network. 

### Ports and Protocols (Applications/Services)

* Physical Ports: Physical ports are the ports on the routers, switches, servers, computers, etc. that you connect the wires, e.g., fiber optic cables, Cat5 cables, etc., to create a network.

* Logical Ports: When a communication connection is established between two systems, it is done using ports. A logical port (also called a socket) is little more than an address number that both ends of the communication link agree to use when transferring data. Ports allow a single IP address to be able to support multiple simultaneous communications, each using a different port number. In the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model (which includes the Session, Presentation, and Application Layers of the OSI model) reside numerous application- or service-specific protocols. Data types are mapped using port numbers associated with services. For example, web traffic (or HTTP) is port 80. Secure web traffic (or HTTPS) is port 443. Table 5.4 highlights some of these protocols and their customary or assigned ports. You’ll note that in several cases a service (or protocol) may have two ports assigned, one secure and one insecure. When in doubt, systems should be implemented using the most secure version as possible of a protocol and its services.

    * Well-known ports (0–1023): These ports are related to the common protocols that are at the core of the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, Domain Name Service (DNS), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), etc.
    * Registered ports (1024–49151): These ports are often associated with proprietary applications from vendors and developers. While they are officially approved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), in practice many vendors simply implement a port of their choosing. Examples include Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication (1812), Microsoft SQL Server (1433/1434) and the Docker REST API (2375/2376).
    * Dynamic or private ports (49152–65535): Whenever a service is requested that is associated with well-known or registered ports, those services will respond with a dynamic port that is used for that session and then released.

### Secure Ports

Some network protocols transmit information in clear text, meaning it is not encrypted and should not be used. Clear text information is subject to network sniffing. This tactic uses software to inspect packets of data as they travel across the network and extract text such as usernames and passwords. Network sniffing could also reveal the content of documents and other files if they are sent via insecure protocols. The table below shows some of the insecure protocols along with recommended secure alternatives.

| Insecure Port | Description | Protocol | Secure Alternative Port | Protocol |
|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| 21 | Port 21, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sends the username and password **using plaintext from the client to the server**. This could be intercepted by an attacker and later used to retrieve confidential information from the server. **The secure alternative, SFTP, on port 22 uses encryption to protect the user credentials and packets of data being transferred** | File Transfer Protocol 	|22* - SFTP	| Secure File Transfer Protocol|
| 23 | Port 23, telnet, is used by many Linux systems and any other systems **as a basic text-based terminal**. All information to and from the host on a telnet connection is sent in plaintext and **can be intercepted by an attacker**. This includes username and password as well as all information that is being presented on the screen, since this interface is all text. **Secure Shell (SSH) on port 22 uses encryption to ensure that traffic between the host and terminal is not sent in a plaintext format**| Telnet | 22* - SSH	| Secure Shell|
| 25 | Port 25, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the default unencrypted port for sending email messages. Since it is unencrypted, data contained within the emails could be discovered by network sniffing. The secure alternative is to use port 587 for SMTP using Transport Layer Security (TLS) which will encrypt the data between the mail client and the mail server| Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | 587 - SMTP	| SMTP with TLS |
| 37 | Port 37, Time Protocol, may be in use by legacy equipment and has mostly been replaced by using port 123 for Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP on port 123 offers better error-handling capabilities, which reduces the likelihood of unexpected errors | Time Protocol | 123 - NTP | Network Time Protocol |
| 53 | Port 53, Domain Name Service (DNS), is still used widely. However, using DNS over TLS (DoT) on port 853 protects DNS information from being modified in transit | Domain Name Service | 853 - DoT | DNS over TLS (DoT) |
| 80 | Port 80, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basis of nearly all web browser traffic on the internet. Information sent via HTTP is not encrypted and is susceptible to sniffing attacks. HTTPS using TLS encryption is preferred, as it protects the data in transit between the server and the browser. Note that this is often notated as SSL/TLS. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) has been compromised is no longer considered secure. It is now recommended for web servers and clients to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 or higher for the best protection | HyperText Transfer Protocol | 443 - HTTPS | HyperText Transfer Protocol (SSL/TLS) |
| 143 | Port 143, Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a protocol used for retrieving emails. IMAP traffic on port 143 is not encrypted and susceptible to network sniffing. The secure alternative is to use port 993 for IMAP, which adds SSL/TLS security to encrypt the data between the mail client and the mail server | Internet Message Access Protocol | 993 - IMAP | IMAP for SSL/TLS |
| 161/162 | Ports 161 and 162, Simple Network Management Protocol, are commonly used to send and receive data used for managing infrastructure devices. Because sensitive information is often included in these messages, it is recommended to use SNMP version 2 or 3 (abbreviated SNMPv2 or SNMPv3) to include encryption and additional security features. Unlike many others discussed here, all versions of SNMP use the same ports, so there is not a definitive secure and insecure pairing. Additional context will be needed to determine if information on ports 161 and 162 is secured or not | Simple Network Management Protocol | 161/162 - SNMP | SNMPv3 |
| 445 | Port 445, Server Message Block (SMB), is used by many versions of Windows for accessing files over the network. Files are transmitted unencrypted, and many vulnerabilities are well-known. Therefore, it is recommended that traffic on port 445 should not be allowed to pass through a firewall at the network perimeter. A more secure alternative is port 2049, Network File System (NFS). Although NFS can use encryption, it is recommended that NFS not be allowed through firewalls either | Server Message Block | 2049 - NFS | Network File System |
| 389 | Port 389, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), is used to communicate directory information from servers to clients. This can be an address book for email or usernames for logins. The LDAP protocol also allows records in the directory to be updated, introducing additional risk. Since LDAP is not encrypted, it is susceptible to sniffing and manipulation attacks. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure (LDAPS) adds SSL/TLS security to protect the information while it is in transit | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol | 636 - LDAPS	| Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure |

## Module 2 Understand Network (Cyber) Threats and Attacks

Domain D4.1.2, D4.2.2, D4.2.3

### Types of Threats

* Spoofing: an attack with the goal of **gaining access to a target system through the use of a falsified identity**. Spoofing can be used against IP addresses, MAC address, usernames, system names, wireless network SSIDs, email addresses, and many other types of logical identification.

* Phising: an attack that **attempts to misdirect legitimate users to malicious websites through** the abuse of **URLs or hyperlinks in emails could be considered phishing**.

* DoS/DDoS: a denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a network resource consumption attack that has the **primary goal of preventing legitimate activity on a victimized system**. Attacks involving numerous unsuspecting secondary victim systems are known as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

* Virus: The computer virus is perhaps the earliest form of malicious code to plague security administrators. As with biological viruses, **computer viruses have two main functions—propagation and destruction**. A virus is a **self-replicating** piece of code that spreads without the consent of a user, but frequently with their assistance (a user has to click on a link or open a file).

* Worm: Worms pose a significant **risk to network security**. They contain the same destructive potential as other malicious code objects with an added twist—they propagate themselves without requiring any human intervention.

* Trojan: the Trojan is a software program **that appears benevolent but carries a malicious**, behind-the-scenes payload that has the potential to wreak havoc on a system or network. For example, ransomware often uses a Trojan to infect a target machine and then uses encryption technology to encrypt documents, spreadsheets and other files stored on the system with a key known only to the malware creator.

* On-path attack: In an on-path attack, attackers place themselves between two devices, often between a web browser and a web server, to intercept or modify information that is intended for one or both of the endpoints. **On-path attacks** are also known as **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.

* Side-channel: A side-channel attack is a **passive**, **noninvasive attack** to **observe the operation of a device**. Methods include power monitoring, timing and fault analysis attacks.

* Advanced Persistent Threat: Advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to **threats that demonstrate an unusually high level of technical and operational sophistication spanning months or even years**. APT attacks are often conducted by highly organized groups of attackers.

* Insider Threat: Insider threats are threats that **arise from individuals who are trusted by the organization**. These could be disgruntled employees or employees involved in espionage. Insider threats are not always willing participants. A trusted user who falls victim to a scam could be an unwilling insider threat.

* Malware: A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, **with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the victim’s data**, applications or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.

* Ransomware: Malware used for the purpose of facilitating a ransom attack. Ransomware attacks often use cryptography to “lock” the files on an affected computer and require the payment of a ransom fee in return for the “unlock” code.

### Identify Threats and Tools Used to Prevent Them

Here are some examples of steps that can be taken to protect networks.  

* If a system doesn’t need a service or protocol, it should not be running. Attackers cannot exploit a vulnerability in a service or protocol that isn’t running on a system. 
* Firewalls can prevent many different types of attacks. Network-based firewalls protect entire networks, and host-based firewalls protect individual systems. 

### Identify Threats and Tools Used to Prevent Them Continued

* Instrusion Detection System (IDS) is a form of monitoring to detect abnormal activity; it detects intrusion attempts and system failures. Identifies Threats, Do not prevent threats
* Host-based IDS (HIDS) monitors activity on a single computer. Identifies threats, Do not prevent Threats.
* Network-based IDS (NIDS) monitors and evaluates network activity to detect attacks or event anomalies. Identifies threats, Do not prevent Threats.
* SIEM gathers log data from sources across an enterprise to understand security concerns and apportion resources. Identifies threats, Do not prevent Threats.
* Anti-malware/Antivirus seeks to identify malicious software or processes. Identifies and Prevent threats.
* Scans evaluates the effectiveness of security controls. Identifies threats, Do not prevent Threats.
* Firewall filters network traffic - managers and controls network traffic and protects the network. Identifies and Prevent threats.
* Intrusion Protection System (IPS-NIPS/HIPS) is an active IDS automatically attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach target systems. Identifies and Prevent threats.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

**An intrusion occurs when an attacker is able to bypass or thwart security mechanisms and gain access to an organization’s resources.** Intrusion detection is a specific form of monitoring **that monitors recorded information and real-time events to detect abnormal activity indicating a potential incident or intrusion**. An intrusion detection system (IDS) **automates the inspection of logs and real-time system events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures**. An IDS is intended as part of a **defense-in-depth security plan**. **IDSs can** recognize attacks that come from external connections and attacks that spread internally. Once they detect a suspicious event, they respond by sending alerts or raising alarms. A primary goal of an IDS is to provide a means for a timely and accurate response to intrusions. 

**IDS types are commonly classified as host-based and network-based. A host-based IDS (HIDS) monitors a single computer or host. A network-based IDS (NIDS) monitors a network by observing network traffic patterns.**

**Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**: A HIDS monitors activity **on a single computer**, including **process calls and information recorded in system, application, security and host-based firewall logs**. It can often examine events in more detail than a NIDS can, and it can pinpoint specific files compromised in an attack. **It can also track processes employed by the attacker.** A benefit of HIDSs over NIDSs is that HIDSs can detect anomalies on the host system that NIDSs cannot detect. For example, **a HIDS can detect infections where an intruder has infiltrated a system and is controlling it remotely.** HIDSs are more costly to manage than NIDSs because they require administrative attention on each system, whereas NIDSs usually support centralized administration. A HIDS cannot detect network attacks on other systems.

**Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**: A NIDS monitors and **evaluates network activity to detect attacks or event anomalies**. **It cannot monitor the content of encrypted traffic but can monitor other packet details**. A single NIDS can monitor **a large network by using remote sensors to collect data at key network locations that send data to a central management console**. These sensors can monitor traffic at **routers, firewalls, network switches that support port mirroring, and other types of network taps**. **A NIDS has very little negative effect on the overall network performance**, and when it is deployed on a single-purpose system, it doesn’t adversely affect performance on any other computer. A NIDS is usually able to detect the initiation of an attack or ongoing attacks, but they can’t always provide information about the success of an attack. They won’t know if an attack affected specific systems, user accounts, files or applications.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Security management involves the **use of tools that collect information about the IT environment from many disparate sources to better examine the overall security of the organization and streamline security efforts**. These tools are generally known as **security information and event management** (or S-I-E-M, pronounced “SIM”) solutions. The general **idea of a SIEM solution is to gather log data from various sources across the enterprise to better understand potential security concerns and apportion resources accordingly**. SIEM systems can be used along with other components (defense-in-depth) as part of an overall information security program.

### Preventing Threats

* Keep systems and applications up to date. Vendors regularly release patches to correct bugs and security flaws, but these only help when they are applied. Patch management ensures that systems and applications are kept up to date with relevant patches. 
* **Remove or disable unneeded services and protocols**. If a system doesn’t need a service or protocol, it should not be running. Attackers cannot exploit a vulnerability in a service or protocol that isn’t running on a system. As an extreme contrast, imagine a web server is running every available service and protocol. It is vulnerable to potential attacks on any of these services and protocols. 
* **Use intrusion detection and prevention systems**. As discussed, intrusion detection and prevention systems observe activity, attempt to detect threats and provide alerts. They can often block or stop attacks.  
* **Use up-to-date anti-malware software**. We have already covered the various types of malicious code such as viruses and worms. A primary countermeasure is anti-malware software.  
* **Use firewalls**. Firewalls can prevent many different types of threats. Network-based firewalls protect entire networks, and host-based firewalls protect individual systems. This chapter included a section describing how firewalls can prevent attacks.

**Antivirus**: it is a requirement for **compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**. Antivirus systems try to identify malware based **on the signature of known malware or by detecting abnormal activity on a system**. This identification is done with various **types of scanners, pattern recognition and advanced machine learning algorithms**. Anti-malware now goes beyond just virus protection as modern solutions try to provide a more holistic approach detecting rootkits, ransomware and spyware. Many endpoint solutions also include software firewalls and IDS or IPS systems.

**Scans**: Regular vulnerability and port scans are a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls used within an organization. They may reveal areas where patches or security settings are insufficient, where new vulnerabilities have developed or become exposed, and where security policies are either ineffective or not being followed. Attackers can exploit any of these vulnerabilities.

**Firewalls**: Early computer security engineers borrowed that name for the devices and services that isolate network segments from each other, as a security measure. As a result, firewalling refers to the process of designing, using or operating different processes in ways that **isolate high-risk activities from lower-risk ones**. **Firewalls enforce policies by filtering network traffic based on a set of rules.** While a firewall should always be placed at internet gateways, other internal network considerations and conditions determine where a firewall would be employed, such as network zoning or segregation of different levels of sensitivity. Firewalls have rapidly evolved over time to provide enhanced security capabilities. **It integrates a variety of threat management capabilities into a single framework, including proxy services, intrusion prevention services (IPS) and tight integration with the identity and access management (IAM) environment to ensure only authorized users are permitted to pass traffic across the infrastructure.** While firewalls can manage traffic **at Layers 2 (MAC addresses)**, **3 (IP ranges)** and **7 (application programming interface (API)** and **application firewalls**), **the traditional implementation has been to control traffic at Layer 4**. Traditional firewalls have PORTS IP Address, IDS/IPS, Antivirus Gateway, WebProxy, VPN; NG Firewalls have PORTS IP Address, IAM Attributes, IDS/IPS, WebProxy, Anti-Bot, Antivirus Gateway, VPN, FaaS.

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a special type of active IDS **that automatically attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach target systems**. A distinguishing difference between an IDS and an IPS is that the **IPS is placed in line with the traffic**. In other words, **all traffic must pass through the IPS and the IPS can choose what traffic to forward and what traffic to block after analyzing it**. This allows the IPS to prevent an attack from reaching a target. Since IPS systems are most effective at preventing network-based attacks, it is common to see the IPS function integrated into firewalls. Just like IDS, there are Network-based IPS (NIPS) and Host-based IPS (HIPS).
