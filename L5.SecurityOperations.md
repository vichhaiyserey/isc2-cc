Domain D5.0, D5.1.1, D5.1.2, D5.1.3

**Hardening** is the process of applying secure configurations (to reduce the attack surface) and locking down various hardware, communications systems and software, including the operating system, web server, application server and applications, etc. This module introduces configuration management practices that will ensure systems are installed and maintained according to industry and organizational security standards. 

### Data Handling

Data itself goes through **its own life cycle as users create**, **use**, **share and modify it**. The data security life cycle model is useful because **it can align easily with the different roles that people and organizations perform during the evolution of data from creation to destruction (or disposal)**. It also helps put the different **data states of in use, at rest and in motion, into context**. 

All ideas, data, information or knowledge can be thought of as going through six major sets of activities throughout its lifetime. Conceptually, these involve:

1. Creating the knowledge, which is usually tacit knowledge at this point.
2. Storing or recording it in some fashion (which makes it explicit).
3. Using the knowledge, which may cause the information to be modified, supplemented or partially deleted.
4. Sharing the data with other users, whether as a copy or by moving the data from one location to another.
5. Archiving the data when it is temporarily not needed.
6. Destroying the data when it is no longer needed.

### Data Handling Practices

* **Classification**: classifications dictate **rules and restrictions about how that information can be used**, **stored** or **shared with others**. All of this is done to keep the temporary value and importance of that information from leaking away. Classification of data, which asks the question “Is it secret?” determines the labeling, handling and use of all data. **Classification is the process of recognizing the organizational impacts if the information suffers any security compromises related to its characteristics of confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability**. **Information is then labeled and handled accordingly**. Classifications are derived from laws, regulations, contract-specified standards or other business expectations. One classification might indicate “minor, may disrupt some processes” while a more extreme one might be “grave, could lead to loss of life or threaten ongoing existence of the organization.” These descriptions should reflect the ways in which the organization has chosen (or been mandated) to characterize and manage risks. The immediate benefit of classification is that it can lead to more efficient design and implementation of security processes, if we can treat the protection needs for all similarly classified information with the same controls strategy. 

* **Labeling**: **security labels are part of implementing controls to protect classified information**. It is reasonable to want a simple way of assigning a level of sensitivity to a data asset, such that the higher the level, the greater the presumed harm to the organization, and thus the greater security protection the data asset requires. This spectrum of needs is useful, but it should not be taken to mean that clear and precise boundaries exist between the use of “low sensitivity” and “moderate sensitivity” labeling, for example. 
    * **Data Sensitivity Levels and Labels**: unless otherwise mandated, organizations are free to create classification systems that best meet their own needs. In professional practice, it is typically best if the organization has enough classifications to distinguish between sets of assets with differing sensitivity/value, but not so many classifications that the distinction between them is confusing to individuals. Typically, two or three classifications are manageable, and more than four tend to be difficult. 

    **Highly restricted**: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s future existence at risk. Compromise could lead to substantial loss of life, injury or property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.
    **Moderately restricted**: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenue or disruption of planned investments or activities.
    **Low sensitivity (sometimes called “internal use only”)**: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays or impacts.
    Unrestricted public data: As this data is already published, no harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure.  

* **Retention**: **Information and data should be kept only for as long as it is beneficial, no more and no less**. Certain industry standards, laws and regulations define retention periods, when such external requirements are not set, it is an organization’s responsibility to define and implement its own data retention policy. **Data retention policies are applicable both for hard copies and for electronic data**, and no data should be kept beyond its required or useful life. **Security professionals should ensure that data destruction is being performed when an asset has reached its retention limit**. For the security professional to succeed in this assignment, an accurate inventory must be maintained, including the asset location, retention period requirement, and destruction requirements. Organizations should conduct a periodic review of retained records in order to reduce the volume of information stored and to ensure that only necessary information is preserved. 

Records retention policies indicate how long an organization is required to maintain information and assets. Policies should guarantee that: 
    * Personnel understand the various retention requirements for data of different types throughout the organization. 
    * The organization appropriately documents the retention requirements for each type of information.
    * The systems, processes and individuals of the organization retain information in accordance with the required schedule but no longer. 
    * A common mistake in records retention is applying the longest retention period to all types of information in an organization. This not only wastes storage but also increases risk of data exposure and adds unnecessary “noise” when searching or processing information in search of relevant records. It may also be in violation of externally mandated requirements such as legislation, regulations or contracts (which may result in fines or other judgments). Records and information no longer mandated to be retained should be destroyed in accordance with the policies of the enterprise and any appropriate legal requirements that may need to be considered. 

* Destruction: Data that might be left on media after deleting is known as remanence and may be a significant security concern. Steps must be taken to reduce the risk that data remanence could compromise sensitive information to an acceptable level. This can be done by one of several means:  

    * Clearing the device or system, which usually involves **writing multiple patterns of random values throughout all storage media**. This is sometimes **called “overwriting” or “zeroizing” the system**, although writing zeros has the risk that a missed block or storage extent may still contain recoverable, sensitive information after the process is completed.
    * Purging the device or system, which eliminates (or greatly reduces) the chance that residual physical effects from the writing of the original data values may still be recovered, even after the system is cleared. Some magnetic disk storage technologies, for example, can still have residual “ghosts” of data on their surfaces even after being overwritten multiple times. Magnetic media, for example, can often be altered sufficiently to meet security requirements; in more stringent cases, degaussing may not be sufficient. 
    * Physical destruction of the device or system is the ultimate remedy to data remanence. Magnetic or optical disks and some flash drive technologies may require being mechanically shredded, chopped or broken up, etched in acid or burned; their remains may be buried in protected landfills, in some cases.
    * In many routine operational environments, security considerations may accept that clearing a system is sufficient. But when systems elements are to be removed and replaced, either as part of maintenance upgrades or for disposal, purging or destruction may be required to protect sensitive information from being compromised by an attacker.  

### Logging and Monitoring Security Events

Logging is the primary form of instrumentation that attempts to capture signals generated by events. Events are any actions that take place within the systems environment and cause measurable or observable change in one or more elements or resources within the system. **Logging imposes a computational cost but is invaluable when determining accountability**. Proper design of logging environments and regular log reviews remain best practices regardless of the type of computer system. 

Major controls frameworks emphasize the importance of organizational logging practices. Information that may be relevant to being recorded and reviewed include (but is not limited to): user IDs, system activities, dates/times of key events (e.g., logon and logoff), device and location identity, successful and rejected system and resource access attempts, system configuration changes and system protection activation and deactivation events. 

**Logging and monitoring the health of the information environment is essential to identifying inefficient or improperly performing systems**, detecting compromises and providing a record of how systems are used. **Robust logging practices provide tools to effectively correlate information from diverse systems to fully understand the relationship between one activity and another**. 

Log reviews are an essential function not only for security assessment and testing but also **for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities and operational problems near the time of occurrence**. Log reviews support audits – forensic analysis related to internal and external investigations – and provide support for organizational security baselines. Review of historic audit logs can determine if a vulnerability identified in a system has been previously exploited. 

It is helpful for an organization to create components of a log management infrastructure and determine how these components interact. This aids in preserving the integrity of log data from accidental or intentional modification or deletion and in maintaining the confidentiality of log data. 

Controls are implemented to protect against unauthorized changes to log information. Operational problems with the logging facility are often related to alterations to the messages that are recorded, log files being edited or deleted, and storage capacity of log file media being exceeded. Organizations must maintain adherence to retention policy for logs as prescribed by law, regulations and corporate governance. Since attackers want to hide the evidence of their attack, the organization’s policies and procedures should also address the preservation of original logs. Additionally, the logs contain valuable and sensitive information about the organization.  Appropriate measures must be taken to protect the log data from malicious use. 

### Event Logging Best Practices

Different tools are used depending on whether the risk from the attack is from traffic coming into or leaving the infrastructure. 

**Ingress monitoring refers to surveillance and assessment of all inbound communications traffic and access attempts.** Devices and tools that offer logging and alerting opportunities for ingress monitoring include: Firewalls, Gateways, Remote authentication servers, IDS/IPS tools, SIEM solutions, 
Anti-malware solutions. 

**Egress monitoring is used to regulate data leaving the organization’s IT environment.** The term currently used in conjunction with this effort is **data loss prevention (DLP)** or **data leak protection**. The DLP solution should be deployed so that it can inspect all forms of data leaving the organization, including: Email (content and attachments), Copy to portable media, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Posting to web pages/websites, Applications/application programming interfaces (APIs). 

### Encryption Overview

Almost every action we take in our modern digital world involves cryptography. Encryption protects our personal and business transactions; digitally signed software updates verify their creator’s or supplier’s claim to authenticity. Digitally signed contracts, binding on all parties, are routinely exchanged via email without fear of being repudiated later by the sender. 

Cryptography is used to protect information by keeping its meaning or content secret and making it unintelligible to someone who does not have a way to decrypt (unlock) that protected information. The objective of every encryption system is to transform an original set of data, called the plaintext, into an otherwise unintelligible encrypted form, called the ciphertext. 

**Properly used**, singly or in combination, **cryptographic solutions provide a range of services that can help achieve required systems security postures in many ways**: 

    **confidentiality**: Cryptography provides confidentiality by hiding or obscuring a message so that it cannot be understood by anyone except the intended recipient. Confidentiality keeps information secret from those who are not authorized to have it. 
    **integrity**: hash functions and digital signatures can provide integrity services that allow a recipient to verify that a message has not been altered by malice or error. These include simple message integrity controls. Any changes, deliberate or accidental, will result in the two results (by sender and by recipient) being different.
